<h2>Instructions webapplication</h2>
<button class="accordion">+ Basic navigation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The most basic navigation functions of the displayed network are explained in the Info box. In the search box the “Search” option is available from the start. Here you can fill in a keyword to search in the network. By clicking on "+ More options", other options become available to get the most out of the results. Here you can choose a keyword from a list of all the available nodes, to highlight and zoom in the chosen keyword. By clicking once or multiple times on “+ Filter by keywords” you can select one or more nodes to remove from the network. Only by clicking on "Filter" the nodes will be removed.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ Gathering information</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>By clicking on either a node or link, the Info box will show new information about the specific item you clicked on. This includes but is not limited to: type (health_effect, compound, organism), information about the associated articles and the total hitcount in all the found articles. In this box, there are several buttons at the bottom. "Release node" sets the node free, if the user has dragged the node (which sets the location of the node). "Zoom in on node" or "Zoom in on link" highlights the node/link and zooms in to that region on the network. "Remove node" or "Remove link" removes the node/link from the network. In case of removing nodes, the associates links with that node will disappear as well. The "Download CSV" button saves the results from either the node or link (see below).
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ Saving results</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Results can be saved in several ways. One is by clicking on "Download as PNG". The network as shown will be saved in a .png format (image). Another way is by clicking on either a link or node and clicking on the "Download CSV" button. Here an comma delimited CSV file is generated. This is a file format that is recognized by Excel and LibreOffice Calc. It contains all the PubMedIDs, article titles and other information about all the scientific articles that are linked to that specific node or link.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<button class="accordion">+ What is text mining?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The basis of text mining is deriving information from text. With our application it means deriving interesting relationships between biochemical keywords to answer biological research questions. In short, this application finds specific keywords using the PubMed database of biochemical research papers to find possible interesting articles. It does this by finding articles which has a combination of two keywords in either the articles abstract, title or both. The number of articles found with this specific combination of keywords, the frequency of occurrence of the keywords and the origin of the found keywords (title or abstract) determines a relationship score between the keywords. By doing this for multiple keywords, a network of keywords (nodes) and the relationships between them (links) will be generated. The network will visualize the strength of the relationships with thicker nodes (relative to the amount of occurrence of the keyword) and thicker links (relative to the amount of overlapping PubMed articles and the placement of the keywords in the abstract or title).
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ What sort of questions can this application answer?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This application cannot directly answer research questions, but it can help to find the right information in literature to find the information a biologist needs. Additionally, it can find indirect relationships between certain keywords. These indirect relationships can show interesting research topics to a new angle that hasn't been found before, or it can help to find research articles with the right information that could not be found by using regular search terms in PubMed.
At a much higher level, the network that is generated with our application can show the relationships between all the keywords at a glance. Clusters of keywords can be distinguished and previously unknown relations are shown.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ How do I use this application to get the most interesting results?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The most interesting results can be found by tweaking and zooming the generated network. To help with this, there are additional functions that can be used find specific relationships. One of them is the "Filter by keywords" option that can be found in the "Search" box by clicking "More options". Here it is possible to select more than one keyword, and show only those keywords and the relations between them. By selecting more than two keywords, indirect relationships are possible to arise.
Another option that can help is temporary removing nodes from the network. This makes the network easier to read and interpret.
<h3><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/helpfigures.png')}}" alt="Finding indirect results in application"></h3>
Figure 1:
Apple has no direct relation with health effect 2, but tomato has a clear direct relationship. However, compound X related to the health effect is also present in apple and therefore could have a relation with this health effect. More researched organisms like <i>C. sativus</i> could create a indirect link to a compound or health effect for a less researched organism like <i>M. charanti</i>.
<BR>Figure 2:
Compound Z has a relation with health effect 1, which is present in cucumber. However no direct link between cucumber and health effect 1 is present, but cucumber might still have this health effect.

<button class="accordion">+ In short: What are the benefits of this application?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>- The application shows at a glance what all the relations are between all the keywords, to which category they belong and how strong the relations are between the keywords. This gives already an overview how all the keywords are connected and possibly find interesting keyword clusters.<BR>
<BR>- The results are filtered to show research papers and reviews. It will not include categories without abstracts like quotes, books, Legal Cases etc.<BR>
<BR>- A scoring system in the application makes keywords that appear in the article title more important compared to keywords that appear only in the abstract of the article. This makes it possible to sort articles in the network results based on relevance.<BR>
<BR>- The network is very dynamic and can be changed by the user for optimal results. The results created by the user can be saved in both a image and Excel format.<BR>
<BR>- By selecting only a select group of keywords, small parts of the network can be shown and visualized. This makes more specific research within the network possible. These results can also be saved as both an image and Excel format for further investigation.

<button class="accordion">+ Which data from PubMed is stored in the application?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>PubMedIDs, article titles, article abstracts, article date, article authors and synonyms of the searched keyword.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ Where can I find the source code of the application?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/JonathanFeenstra/BATMAN">GitHub</a>
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">+ What are the assumptions and shortcomings of this application? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>- This application uses the thickness of the nodes and links to visualize the strength of the relationships. A thicker node represents the occurrence of the keyword in all found articles and a thicker link tells you about the amount of overlapping articles and where the keyword is found (abstract or title). However, the more articles or the amount keywords within the articles that are found does not necessarily mean that these keywords or links are more important than others. Some keywords are simply more available in the PubMed database, like cancer vs. osteoporosis or <i>A. thaliana</i> vs. <i>M. charantia</i>. This creates a bias towards these keywords. This also happens with links between keywords, where diabetes+insulin have more overlapping articles and number of found keywords, because these search terms are found in more PubMed articles than for a less known disease and the corresponding acting substance. A possible solution for this problem is to show the results of only a few keywords with the “+ Filter by keywords” option (explained in "Basic navigation"). Here the thin links and/or small nodes can show a indirect relationship. See example at "FAQ - How do I use this application to get the most interesting results?".<BR>
<BR>- Some results with a test dataset resulted in incomplete abstracts. Further investigation about this showed, that the articles were not filled in correctly by the publishers of that articles. Simply said, this means that the file that our program gets back (a XML file) is incomplete and can therefore not be used to its full potential. According to PubMed, this is the responsibility of the publishers. In the test dataset, there was only two articles that had this problem, but these kinds of articles could be missed by this application.<BR>
<BR>- PubMed makes use of synonyms for their search results. Possible wrong synonyms could therefore be added in the found articles. To help you determine if this is the case, clicking on a nodes shows the list of synonyms that PubMed used. Additionally, certain keywords could possibly be a synonym of another keyword in the network, which will cause overlapping results. Therefore it is always necessary to check the used synonyms of interesting parts of the network.<BR>
<BR>- This application only searches in the titles, abstracts and keyword lists of all PubMed IDs. This means that articles outside of PubMed are not included. Additionally, not the whole article is used for the text mining search. The reasoning behind this is because most papers are in subscription journals. To see the full text a payment or subscription to that specific publisher/journal is needed. Using free articles only will naturally exclude many interesting papers and using the full text only for free articles will create a big bias towards those articles.<BR>
<BR>- Links between keywords within the same category (compound, health effect or organism) is avoided as much as possible. This is because of two reasons. One is that these are results that are most of the time uninformative for the research question. Secondly, by not including these relations the network will be less clustered and more readable. It will create big clusters of the same category, for example all health effects will be clustered together and linked to almost every other health effect. The more interesting relations for the research question (between compounds and health effects) will become unreadable and because of the bias be found less important by the application in the form of small nodes and thin links.
